## Synopsis

Diffusion Limited Aggregation running on the browser with javascript.

## Basic Idea

on a binary grid with only a central point active, random walkers are added and move until they stick to an active grid point, resulting in an interesting shape.

## Installation

cd to a directory of your choosing, then
	   
	git clone git@github.com:ShrimCity/DLA.git
   
Then simply navigate to the file on your browser

   	file:///path/to/DLA/index.html
   	
or ...
	
	open index.html

## Features I would like to add soon

-  Radius of entry and exit of random walkers is not optimized to speed up growth
-  GUI-style options such as color chooser, stop, start, speed, etc.
-  Suggestions welcome

## License

Use this in whatever way is useful to you!
